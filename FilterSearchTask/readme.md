# React.js skills assessment test

## Assignment

Your task is to create one-page application with list of clients and their details. Clients data are stored in 'clients.json' which must be loaded dynamically via http request.

If you think you have demonstrated your current knowledge without building all of the functionality of the wireframe, that is fine, please don't assume that you must complete the whole page. I'd rather see one well thought out piece of functionality instead of the whole page working poorly.


## Wireframe description:
* **Clients list:** Every item will display smaller avatar clients name and job title. When user clicks on an item, it will display client's details on the right.
* **Search:** It will filter all informations, not only those showed in the clients list. Results are displayed as filtered out list of clients and they will appear instantly as user types.
* **Client's details:** Full size avatar (128x128px) and all other client's informations.

## Stack

* plain javascript (no coffescript, typescript, â€¦). this is a general webpack es6 setup included. 

run it by doing:

* yarn install
* yarn start.
* navigate to http://localhost:8080

if you have any problems with this configuration just email me at rsavage@criticalmass.com, don't get stuck trying to fix the actual webpack config. 


* react.js included
* redux, flux or none
* use a basic SCSS framework
* git is required
